									<p>What is Virtualization?</p>
								</header>
								<p>Virtualization is the process of designing a version of anything virtual in nature. It is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
								<br>
									Server virtualization provided a variety of benefits, one of the biggest being the ability to consolidate applications onto a single system. But this approach has had its drawbacks. Each VM includes a separate operating system image, which adds overhead in memory and storage footprint.

									<p>What is Containerization</p>
								</header>
								<p>Containerization is one of the substitutes of full machine virtualization. It is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS). Containers sit on top of a physical server and its host OS—for example, Linux or Windows.
									<br>
									Containerization is more efficient because they share a common operating system, only a single operating system needs care and feeding for bug fixes, patches, and so on. This concept is similar to what we experience with hypervisor hosts: fewer management points but slightly higher fault domain. In short, containers are lighter weight and more portable than virtualization machines.</p>

						<h3>Data Centers and The Cloud</h3>
						<p>What is a Data Center?</p>
					</header>
					<p>A data center is a physical facility that organizations use to house their critical applications and data. Its design is based on a network of computing and storage resources that enable the delivery of shared applications and data. The key components of a data center design include routers, switches, firewalls, storage systems, servers, and application-delivery controllers. Data center components require significant infrastructure to support the center's hardware and software. These include power subsystems, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), ventilation, cooling systems, fire suppression, backup generators, and connections to external networks.</p>

					<header>
						<p>What is The Cloud?</p>
					</header>
					<p>Essentially, a cloud data service is a remote version of a data center. "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines. The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. Cloud computing is possible because virtualization allows for the creation of a simulated, digital-only "virtual" computer that behaves as if it were a physical computer with its own hardware.</p>

						<h3>Kubernetes and Docker</h3>
						<p>How do these two work together?</p>
					</header>
					<p>In principle, Kubernetes can work with any containerization technology. It is a portable, extensible, and open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem -- their  services, support, and tools are widely available. Two of the most popular options that Kubernetes can integrate with are RKT and Docker. However, Docker has the most mindshare, which has led to much more effort in perfecting the integration between it and Kubernetes more than any other containerization technology. </p>
					<p>Docker is a standalone software that can be installed on any computer to run containerized applications. Docker is what enables us to run, create and manage containers on a single operating system. If you have Docker installed on a bunch of hosts (different operating systems), you can leverage Kubernetes. These nodes, or Docker hosts, can be bare-metal servers or virtual machines. Kubernetes can then allow you to automate container provisioning, networking, load-balancing, security and scaling across all these nodes from a single command line or dashboard. A collection of nodes that is managed by a single Kubernetes instance is referred to as a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes automates the process of scaling, managing, updating and removing containers. In other words, it is a container orchestration platform. While Docker is at the heart of the containerization, it enables you to have containers in the first place.</p>

					<h5>Docker Tutorial</h5>
					<blockquote>From the Docker Hub dashboard, click Create Repository. Fill out the repository details (be sure to set the Visibility drop-down to either public or private), then click Create. On the next page you will find details about your new repository, including the docker pull command for your images.
						<br>
						To push an image to Docker Hub, you must first name your local image using your Docker Hub username and the repository name that you created through Docker Hub on the web.
						<br>
						You can add multiple images to a repository by adding a specific html element: "tag" to them (for example "docs/base:testing"). If it’s not specified, the tag defaults to "latest".
